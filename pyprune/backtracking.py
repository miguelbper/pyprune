"""Backtracking algorithm for solving constraint satisfaction problems.

Offers a Backtracking class that implements a backtracking algorithm.
The class is general purpose and can be used to solve any constraint
satisfaction puzzle. However, the class does not know the rules of any
specific problem. Users should inherit from this class and add the rules
of the problem.

    Private methods (only meant to be called by the class):

            Generates solutions using the backtracking algorithm.

        grid(cm: Choices) -> Grid:
