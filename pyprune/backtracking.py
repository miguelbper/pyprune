"""Backtracking algorithm for solving constraint satisfaction problems.

Offers a Backtracking class that implements a backtracking algorithm.
The class is general purpose and can be used to solve any constraint
satisfaction puzzle. However, the class does not know the rules of any
specific problem. Users should inherit from this class and add the rules
of the problem.

    Usage:
        - Define a new class that inherits from this class.
        - Define a prune method.
        - Optionally override the expand method.
        - Instantiate by providing initial choices matrix.
        - Call 'solution' or 'solutions' to find the solution(s).

    Attributes:
        cm (Choices): The initial matrix of choices.

    Public methods (meant to be called by the user):
        __init__(self, cm: Choices) -> None:
            Initializes a Backtracking object.

        solution(self) -> Grid | None:
            Finds a solution using the backtracking algorithm.

        solutions(self) -> list[Grid]:
            Returns a list of all possible solutions for the problem.

    Private methods (only meant to be called by the class):
        solution_generator(self) -> Iterator[Grid]:
            Generates solutions using the backtracking algorithm.

        grid(cm: Choices) -> Grid:
            Converts from a choices matrix to a grid.

        reject(cm: Choices | None) -> bool:
            True if cm is None or if cm has an empty cell.

        accept(cm: Choices) -> bool:
            Checks if all elements of the choice matrix are singletons.

        expand(self, cm: Choices) -> list[Choices]:
            Chooses a cell and lists the possible values for that cell.
